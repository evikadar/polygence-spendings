# polygence-spendings

This is a frontend app created to manage spendings.

I set it up with React Typescript and used some skeleton I had from a PWA project with React Router DOM for routing (it's not really needed here but I left it in it ~~to flex~~ in case it's extended), axios and antd as a framework library. I used Styled components for CSS.

Looks like this:

How to run it
1. Clone the repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Open at localhost:3000

There are obviously a bunch of possible areas to improve, like:
- type the filterValue as the currency
- improve CSS, especially on the form currency selection's
- make it more responsive
- add unit tests
- add comment for all the components
